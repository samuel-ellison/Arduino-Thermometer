This is NOT to be used for future students trying to complete the class. The purpose is to backup my work and for fututre reference.

In this project, I constructed a temperature sensor using a thermistor from an Arduino Kit. I set up the system to probe temperatures accurate from ice to steam point of water. The device is complete with start & stop buttons, user input for sampling frequency, and a thermal equilibrium sensor. The files I have included are the Arduino code, my Preliminary Design presentation, and my Critical Design presentation. For more details, check out these YouTube videos for system descriptions, functions, and explanations.
